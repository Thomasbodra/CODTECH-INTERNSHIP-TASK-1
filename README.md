# overview of the Project
start by creating a basic Python quiz application that’s only capable of asking a question, collecting an answer, and checking whether the answer is correct. From there, you’ll add more and more features in order to make your app more interesting, user-friendly, and fun.

You’ll build the quiz application iteratively by going through the following steps:

  1.Create a basic application that can ask multiple-choice questions.
  2.Make the app more user-friendly by improving how it looks and how it handles user 
    errors.
  3.Refactor the code to use functions.
  4.Separate question data from source code by storing questions in a dedicated data file.
  5.Expand the app to handle multiple correct answers, give hints, and provide explanations.
  6.Add interest by supporting different quiz topics to choose from.
    As you follow along, you’ll gain experience in starting with a small script and expanding it. This is an important skill in and of itself.
